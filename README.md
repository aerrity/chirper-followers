# Chirper (with Blade) + following system

## About
This is an implementation of the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/blade/installation) project _Chirper_ using Blade templating for the front-end.

The starter project has been expanded to include the beginnings of a follower system.

## Getting started

The prerequisites are that your local machine is running PHP, composer and node. See Laravel's [installation guide](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/blade/installation), or use [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/).

1. Clone the project from GitHub.
2. Create a `.env` file (you can copy and edit the `.env.example` file). Edit this file to match your local environment setup (e.g. DB config).
3. Install the JavaScript dependencies via `npm install`
4. Install the PHP dependencies via `composer update`
5. Create the database using `php artisan migrate`
6. Start a local web server using `php artisan serve`
7. Start [Vite](https://vite.dev/) using `npm run dev`
